# Master Prompt: Autonomous GitHub Mirror Build (Convex + Effect + Confect)

You are Claude Opus running fully autonomously in this repository.

Your mission is to convert this codebase into a fast GitHub UI backed by Convex as a cache/sync layer.

GitHub is the source of truth.
Convex is the low-latency read model.

## Project Context (Read First)

- You are currently in `create-epoch-app`, which is a starter template.
- Nothing in this template is sacred.
- Backward compatibility is **not required**.
- You may freely add/rename/remove modules as needed.
- You may upgrade/change Convex packages and Convex React usage whenever necessary.

## Resolved Decisions (Feb 2026)

These decisions were made before autonomous execution began. Do not re-ask.

1. **GitHub App → Not needed initially.** Use **repository-level webhooks** with the existing GitHub OAuth token / PAT. Repos are added manually via an admin mutation or CLI, which creates a repo-level webhook via `gh api`. The `installationId` field is kept in schema for forward-compatibility with a future GitHub App migration, but populated with `0` in repo-webhook mode.
2. **Git → Local repo only.** No remote push unless explicitly requested. Commit locally with clear messages.
3. **Starter code → Nuke domain, preserve patterns.** Delete guestbook/posts/users domain code. Keep confect setup patterns, UI component library (`@packages/ui`), observability infra as scaffolding. Ignore `apps/discord-bot` (out of scope).
4. **Auth → Public, no login required.** Strip Better Auth from active schema and HTTP routes. The `@packages/ui` components and auth packages can stay installed for future use, but nothing in the active codepath should require authentication.
5. **Confect → All tables.** Use Confect `defineTable` with Effect Schema for every table, including ingestion plumbing (webhook_events_raw, sync_jobs, dead_letters). Consistent patterns everywhere.
6. **Testing → `@packages/convex-test` is primary.** Use fixture payloads, reproducible webhook harnesses, and Convex-test integration tests. No external dependencies required for CI-critical tests.

## Product Objective

Build a GitHub mirror system where:

1. GitHub repo-level webhooks stream incremental updates into Convex.
2. Backfill jobs pull historical data from GitHub REST/GraphQL API into Convex.
3. Reconciliation jobs repair missed or out-of-order changes.
4. One-time repository bootstrap sync runs automatically when new repositories are connected.
5. The UI reads from Convex projections only for fast, stable page loads.
6. Repos are connected manually (admin mutation / CLI command) — no GitHub App installation flow needed initially.

## Current State (Reality Check)

The original MVP scope in this file is now largely complete and validated.

- Backend slices 0-8 are implemented (ingestion, backfill, webhook processing, projections, replay/reconcile).
- UI list/detail views are implemented with projection-backed reads only.
- Convex-test integration coverage exists and passes.
- Additional post-MVP commits landed after Session 9:
  - `361cf30` added issue/PR detail pages and corresponding projection query endpoints.
  - `56c3865` fixed CORS preflight + HMR loop behavior and hardened RPC client atom reference stability.

This means the old "build MVP mirror" mission is done. The next phase is production hardening and scale.

## Active Scope (Phase 2)

<!-- ACTIVE_SCOPE_START -->
You are continuing FasterGH after MVP completion. Do not restart old slices.

Current product posture:
- Core mirror pipeline works end-to-end.
- UI reads from Convex projections.
- Tests cover core webhook/projection/idempotency flows.

New mission:
Evolve FasterGH from "works for one test repo" into a production-ready, multi-repo, operable service.

Day-to-day usability target for this loop:
- FasterGH should be usable as the primary daily GitHub interface for personal workflow, without GitHub App auth flows.
- Authentication model remains unchanged for now: no in-app auth, no GitHub App install; use existing PAT/`gh` credentials in backend environment.
- "Usable" means read + core write workflows are available and reliable for normal PR/issue-driven development.

Future auth migration intent (keep architecture ready):
- PAT-backed GitHub API access is a temporary bridge.
- Design new write/read services behind stable Effect service interfaces so token source can switch without UI/RPC churn.
- After this loop, replace PAT credential flow with GitHub App installation-token flow.

Definition of usable (must-have before closing this loop):
1. Multi-repo dashboard + repo detail UX stays fast on realistic data sizes.
2. PR workflows: list/detail, diff view, comments/reviews visibility, check run visibility, merge action.
3. Issue workflows: list/detail, create issue, comment, close/reopen.
4. Basic authoring actions from UI via backend RPC (PAT-backed):
   - create issue
   - create issue comment
   - create PR comment/review comment (minimum viable review interaction)
   - merge PR
5. Sync reliability: webhook ingest + async processing + replay/reconcile fully operational with observable queue health.

Delivery order for Phase 2:

9. **Async processing architecture + scheduler hardening**
   - Move webhook processing off the request path into queued job processing (`github_sync_jobs` / event-processing worker).
   - Add cron-driven worker loops for pending sync jobs and replay/reconcile jobs.
   - Enforce retry/backoff policy and bounded failure transitions to dead letters.
   - Keep webhook HTTP endpoint fast: verify + persist + enqueue only.

10. **Data completeness and correctness expansion**
   - Add PR diff sync pipeline: ingest PR file list and patch hunks from GitHub, keep bounded payload sizes, and upsert idempotently by repo/PR/file identity.
   - Extend detail projections/queries so PR detail pages can render file-by-file diffs from Convex (no direct GitHub API read on page load).
   - Define truncation/fallback rules when GitHub omits patch content (binary files, oversized patches, or API truncation).
   - Fill remaining entity gaps in detail views (for example richer PR/issue timeline coverage where needed).
   - Strengthen out-of-order/version guards for all mutable entities.
   - Add consistency checks between normalized and projection tables (repair hooks or scheduled repair jobs).

11. **Core write workflows (PAT-backed, no auth app flow)**
   - Add Effect + Confect RPC endpoints for core GitHub write actions (issue create/comment/state, PR comment/review minimum, PR merge).
   - Keep GitHub as source of truth: execute write via GitHub API, then reconcile local read model through webhook/reconcile path.
   - Add idempotency keys / dedupe guards for user-triggered writes where practical.

12. **Query/UI scalability pass**
   - Add cursor pagination for large PR/issue/activity lists.
   - Add URL-driven filter/sort state using `nuqs` (state survives refresh/share).
   - Ensure detail pages and list pages remain responsive on large repos (no unbounded queries in hot paths).

13. **Operational visibility**
    - Add admin/ops queries for queue depth, lag, failure rates, and stale projections.
    - Add structured logging around webhook ingest latency, processing latency, retries, and dead-letter growth.

14. **Release hardening**
   - Add integration tests for currently under-tested events (check_run updates, issue_comment edits/deletes, PR review transitions).
   - Add integration tests for write workflows (issue create/comment/close, PR comment/review, merge) with deterministic fixtures.
   - Add smoke test script for onboarding a new repo and validating end-to-end state.
   - Refresh root docs (`README.md`) so this repo no longer reads like the starter template.

15. **Post-loop migration prep: PAT -> GitHub App**
   - Introduce a GitHub auth/token provider service abstraction used by read/write GitHub clients.
   - Capture required installation metadata and webhook compatibility constraints for app-mode cutover.
   - Add migration checklist to switch from PAT environment variables to GitHub App credentials with minimal downtime.

Execution constraints for this phase:
- Keep public read-only UX; avoid introducing full auth unless explicitly requested.
- Favor additive migrations and safe rollouts over sweeping rewrites.
- Continue using Effect + Confect patterns and no type assertions.
- Update this file as work lands; append status notes every session.
- For all new GitHub API code, avoid hard-coding PAT assumptions; code to an auth provider interface.

When this active scope is complete, output `<I HAVE COMPLETED THE TASK>`.

### Status Notes

**Slice 9 — COMPLETE** (session 2026-02-18)
- Schema: Added `processAttempts` (number), `nextRetryAt` (nullable number), and `"retry"` state variant to `github_webhook_events_raw`. Added `by_processState_and_nextRetryAt` index.
- `http.ts`: Already modified (previous session) — webhook endpoint only verifies + persists + returns 200. No inline processing.
- `webhookProcessor.ts`: Rewrote `processAllPending` with full retry/backoff/dead-letter pipeline. On failure with attempts < 5, events transition to "retry" with exponential backoff (1s * 2^attempt + jitter). On exhaustion (>= 5 attempts), events move to `github_dead_letters` and are removed from raw events. Added `promoteRetryEvents` internal mutation and `getQueueHealth` internal query.
- `crons.ts`: Created with two cron intervals — `processAllPending` every 10s, `promoteRetryEvents` every 30s.
- Deleted placeholder `syncWorker.ts` — all functionality absorbed into `webhookProcessor.ts`.
- Updated `webhookIngestion.ts`, `replayReconcile.ts`, and test helpers with new schema fields.
- All 21 tests passing.

**Slice 10 — COMPLETE** (session 2026-02-18)
- **10a**: Added `github_pull_request_files` table to schema with `by_repositoryId_and_pullRequestNumber_and_headSha` and `by_repositoryId_and_pullRequestNumber_and_filename` indexes.
- **10b**: Added `syncPrFiles` (internal action: paginated GitHub API fetch with patch truncation at 100KB, max 300 files) and `upsertPrFiles` (internal mutation: idempotent insert/update by repo/PR/filename) to `githubActions.ts`.
- **10c**: Added PR file sync trigger to `webhookProcessor.ts` for `opened`/`synchronize`/`reopened` actions via `ctx.scheduler.runAfter`.
- **10d**: Added `listPrFiles` query to `projectionQueries.ts` — returns files by headSha or latest PR headSha.
- **10e**: Added `repairProjections` internal mutation to `admin.ts` + `queueHealth` query. Registered in `crons.ts` (5-min interval).
- **10f**: Added 6 tests for PR diff pipeline (upsertPrFiles insert, idempotent update, listPrFiles query, empty PR, headSha filter, webhook trigger).

**Slice 11 — COMPLETE** (session 2026-02-18)
- **New table**: `github_write_operations` with state machine (`pending` → `completed`/`failed` → `confirmed`).
- **`githubWrite.ts` created** with 4 public mutations (`createIssue`, `createComment`, `updateIssueState`, `mergePullRequest`), 1 internal action (`executeWriteOperation`), 3 internal mutations (`markWriteCompleted`, `markWriteFailed`, `confirmWriteOperation`), 1 internal query (`getWriteOperation`), 1 public query (`listWriteOperations`).
- **Optimistic write pattern**: Mutations insert "pending" row with optimistic data, then `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0)` kicks off the GitHub API action.
- **Deduplication** via `correlationId` — duplicate creates return `DuplicateOperationError`.
- **Webhook reconciliation** added to `webhookProcessor.ts` — confirms completed write ops when matching webhook arrives.
- **9 new tests** (createIssue, createComment, markWriteCompleted, markWriteFailed, webhook reconciliation, listWriteOperations, updateIssueState, mergePullRequest, deduplication).

**Slice 12 — COMPLETE** (session 2026-02-18)
- **12a**: Added 3 paginated query endpoints to `projectionQueries.ts`: `listPullRequestsPaginated`, `listIssuesPaginated`, `listActivityPaginated` with cursor pagination and optional state filter.
- **12b**: RPC client auto-picks up new endpoints via `ProjectionQueriesModule` type.
- **12c**: Created `search-params.ts` with nuqs parsers for repo detail page (`tab` and `state` query params).
- **12d**: Rewrote repo detail page with nuqs URL state, `StateFilterBar` component, and filter-aware subscriptions.
- **12e**: Activity feed uses `limit: 50` param.
- **12f**: Fixed unbounded `.collect()` in hot paths — all list queries now use `.take()` bounds (100/200/500 depending on context). Added 2 new indexes (`by_repositoryId_and_state_and_sortUpdated`) for efficient state filtering.
- **12g**: Added 7 paginated query tests (cursor continuation, state filter, empty repo handling for PRs/issues/activity).
- **Total**: 40 tests passing (18 original + 6 PR diff + 9 write ops + 7 paginated).

**Slice 13 — COMPLETE** (session 2026-02-18)
- Added `systemStatus` public query to `admin.ts` — comprehensive operational dashboard with queue health, processing lag (avg/max pending age), stale retry detection, write op state summary, and projection sync status.
- Fixed unbounded `.collect()` in `tableCounts` (admin) — all table scans now use `.take(10001)` with cap at 10000.
- Fixed unbounded `.collect()` in `getQueueHealth` (webhookProcessor) — same bounded pattern.
- Added structured `console.info` logging to `processAllPending` and `promoteRetryEvents` for observability.

**Effect-atom state lifecycle fix — COMPLETE** (session 2026-02-18)
- Root cause: `RegistryProvider` in `convex-client-provider.tsx` was created without `defaultIdleTTL`, so atoms were cleaned up immediately when all listeners unsubscribed (component unmount). The default context fallback uses 400ms, but explicitly creating a `RegistryProvider` without the option results in `undefined` (no TTL → immediate cleanup).
- Fix: Added `defaultIdleTTL={30_000}` (30 seconds) to `<RegistryProvider>` in `packages/ui/src/components/convex-client-provider.tsx`. This keeps atom state alive for 30s after unmount, surviving tab switches, navigation, and React Suspense boundaries.
- One-line change, all 52 tests pass, typecheck clean.

**Slice 14 — Route-based tabs with zero-skeleton server prefetch — COMPLETE** (session 2026-02-18)
- **Goal**: Replace client-side `<Tabs>` component with real Next.js routes (`/pulls`, `/issues`, `/activity`) backed by server-side data prefetching, eliminating all loading skeletons on navigation.
- **Prefetch on links**: Changed `prefetch={false}` → `prefetch={true}` in centralized `<Link>` component (`packages/ui/src/components/link.tsx`).
- **Pulls page** (previously completed): `pulls/page.tsx` is a server component that prefetches open PRs via `serverQueries.listPullRequests.queryPromise()`; `pulls/pulls-client.tsx` uses `useSubscriptionWithInitial` for instant render + live updates.
- **Issues page**: Split monolithic client component into `issues/page.tsx` (server component, prefetches open issues) + `issues/issues-client.tsx` (client component with `useSubscriptionWithInitial`). Zero skeletons on default view.
- **Activity page**: Split monolithic client component into `activity/page.tsx` (server component, prefetches last 50 activities) + `activity/activity-client.tsx` (client component with `useSubscriptionWithInitial`). Zero skeletons.
- **Layout header**: Split `layout.tsx` into server component (prefetches repo overview) + `layout-client.tsx` (client component with `useSubscriptionWithInitial` for live overview updates). Header renders instantly on first visit with no skeleton.
- **Root redirect**: `[owner]/[name]/page.tsx` redirects to `/pulls` (8 lines).
- **URL state**: `search-params.ts` simplified to only state filter (tab parsers removed since tabs are now routes).
- **Back-links**: PR detail and issue detail pages updated to point to `/pulls` and `/issues` routes respectively.
- **Pattern**: Server component → `queryPromise()` → pass promise to client → `use(promise)` suspends server-side → `useSubscriptionWithInitial(atom, initialData)` provides instant data + live subscription fallover.
- All 52 tests pass, typecheck clean across all packages.

**Slice 15 — PAT → GitHub App migration prep — COMPLETE** (session 2026-02-18)
- **Token provider abstraction**: Created `GitHubTokenProvider` Effect service in `packages/database/convex/shared/githubApi.ts`. Defines `getToken: Effect.Effect<string>` interface. Current implementation: `GitHubTokenProvider.Pat` reads `GITHUB_PAT` from `process.env`, dies on missing (unrecoverable config error, matching original `Effect.die` behavior).
- **`GitHubApiClient` refactored**: `Default` layer now depends on `GitHubTokenProvider` (via `yield* GitHubTokenProvider`). New `Live` layer = `Default` + `Pat` (drop-in for production). `fromToken` static remains for test/manual use.
- **All 7 consumer sites updated**: `GitHubApiClient.Default` → `GitHubApiClient.Live` in `githubActions.ts`, `githubWrite.ts`, `repoOnboard.ts`, `repoBootstrapImpl.ts`, `onDemandSync.ts`.
- **Zero consumer signature changes**: All consumers still `yield* GitHubApiClient` and call `.use(fn)`. Error channels unchanged.
- **Migration path documented**: See GitHub App Migration Checklist below.
- All 52 tests pass, typecheck clean.

### GitHub App Migration Checklist

When ready to migrate from PAT to GitHub App:

**1. Create GitHub App**
- Register a GitHub App with required permissions (issues, pull_requests, checks, contents, metadata)
- Enable webhook events: `push`, `pull_request`, `issues`, `issue_comment`, `check_run`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`
- Generate a private key and store securely

**2. Store App Credentials in Convex**
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` — GitHub App client ID (JWT issuer)
- `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` — PEM-encoded private key
- Store in Convex environment variables (not `.env` for production)

**3. Implement `GitHubTokenProvider.Installation`**
```
static Installation = (installationId: number) =>
  Layer.effect(
    this,
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      // Use GITHUB_CLIENT_ID + GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY to generate JWT
      // Exchange JWT for installation access token via POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens
      // Cache token until expires_at (typically 1 hour)
      // Return cached token or refresh on expiry
    }),
  );
```

**4. Update `GitHubApiClient.Live`**
- Change from `Layer.provide(Default, GitHubTokenProvider.Pat)` to `Layer.provide(Default, GitHubTokenProvider.Installation(installationId))`
- Installation ID comes from `github_installations` table (already in schema)

**5. Webhook Verification Changes**
- Current: HMAC-SHA256 with `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- GitHub App: Same mechanism, secret is per-app (configure in App settings)
- No code change needed if secret env var is updated

**6. Multi-Repo Token Scoping**
- PAT: One token for all repos
- GitHub App: One installation per org/user account, token scoped to installed repos
- May need to look up installation ID per repository and cache tokens per installation

**7. Deprecation Path**
- Phase 1: Run both PAT and App in parallel (App for new repos, PAT for existing)
- Phase 2: Migrate existing repos to App
- Phase 3: Remove PAT code path and `GitHubTokenProvider.Pat`
- Remove `GITHUB_PAT` from environment

<!-- ACTIVE_SCOPE_END -->

## Prerequisites

Before the sync pipeline works end-to-end, these must be in place:

- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` set in `.env` (already done)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` and `CONVEX_SITE_URL` set (already done)
- A GitHub PAT or OAuth token available via `gh auth status` (already done)
- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set in `.env` (to be generated during Slice 0)
- A **public test repo** on `RhysSullivan`'s GitHub account for end-to-end testing (created during Slice 0)

Not needed initially:
- GitHub App ID / private key (future migration)
- Better Auth secrets (stripped from active use)

## Test Repository

Create a public repo `RhysSullivan/fastergh-test` via `gh repo create` during Slice 0. This repo is used for:

- End-to-end webhook delivery testing (real webhooks from GitHub → Convex HTTP endpoint)
- Backfill / bootstrap testing against real GitHub API data
- Creating test issues, PRs, branches, and commits programmatically via `gh` CLI
- Validating the full pipeline: webhook → ingestion → normalized tables → projections → UI

The test repo should be treated as disposable — it can be deleted and recreated at any time. All CI-critical tests remain offline-capable via fixture replay, but live smoke tests use this repo.

## Autonomy Rules

1. Work in small vertical slices: schema -> sync -> projection -> UI -> tests.
2. Commit frequently with clear messages.
3. Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for GitHub operations.
4. Use Convex CLI for deploy/run/log/sync operations.
5. Prefer idempotent and replay-safe behavior over shortcuts.
6. Assume webhook events can be delayed, duplicated, or out-of-order.
7. Keep the repo in a runnable state after each slice.
8. **This plan is a living document.** Update it autonomously whenever you discover better approaches, resolve ambiguities, or learn something that future sessions need to know. Don't ask permission to edit this file — just do it and note what changed in the status notes. The goal is for this file to always reflect the current best understanding of the project.
9. **No workarounds or hackery.** If a library or internal package doesn't support what you need, fix the library. Specifically: if Confect doesn't expose proper types, update `packages/confect/src/`. If Effect patterns need a utility, add it. The codebase should be clean and correct, not held together with adapter shims.

## Repeated Prompt / Resume Protocol (Important)

Assume this master prompt is sent repeatedly in fresh sessions.

Treat this file as a goal reminder plus execution ledger.

At the start of every run, do this before coding:

1. Read `PLAN.md` status notes to find the last completed step and next intended step.
2. Inspect git state (`git status`, recent commits, current branch) to confirm actual progress.
3. Reconcile differences between notes and code reality.
4. Continue from the highest-value unfinished slice.
5. If previous run was interrupted, recover safely from partial work (do not restart from zero unless necessary).

End every run by appending a short status block in this file with:

- completed work,
- in-progress work,
- exact next command/function/task to run,
- blockers or risks.

## Personal Notes Protocol

Write ongoing notes to `personal-notes/` as you work.

- Keep a running implementation note per workstream with descriptive filenames.
- Create new files when starting a distinct investigation or subsystem.
- Include concrete breadcrumbs: decisions, tradeoffs, failed attempts, and why.
- Record exact commands/results that matter for resuming work quickly.
- Prefer filenames like `github_sync_bootstrap_design_feb_2026.md`.
- Do not store secrets/tokens in notes.

## Stack and Code Constraints

- Use `bun` for package scripts/commands.
- Use Effect services/layers and tagged errors.
- Keep using Confect patterns for typed Convex RPC modules.
- Do not use TypeScript `any`, `unknown`, or type assertions.
- Prefer existing monorepo package import conventions.
- Write backend sync/data tests using `@packages/convex-test` (do not skip Convex-test-based coverage).

## Architecture

Core pipeline:

`GitHub API + GitHub Webhooks -> Ingestion -> Normalized Convex Tables -> Projection Tables -> Next.js UI`

### What We Sync (and What We Don't)

**In scope:** Repository metadata, branches, commits (metadata only), pull requests, PR reviews, issues, issue comments, check runs, and pull request file diffs (changed files + patch hunks for review UX). This remains primarily a metadata mirror with scoped code-diff support.

**Explicitly out of scope:**
- **Full repository file/code sync** — no tree/blob mirror and no generic code browser outside PR diff context
- **Git object storage** — no cloning repos or storing git packs
- **Code search** — no indexing of source files
- **Release assets / packages** — not synced
- **GitHub Actions workflow definitions** — only check run results are synced, not workflow YAML
- **Discussions / Projects / Wiki** — not in initial scope

Sync modes:

1. **Bootstrap Backfill**: initial hydration.
2. **Realtime Webhook Sync**: ongoing updates.
3. **Periodic Reconciliation**: drift and gap repair.
4. **One-Time Repository Bootstrap**: immediate first sync for newly added repos.

## Data Model (Target)

Implement 3 layers in Convex:

1. Raw ingest layer (audit + replay)
2. Normalized canonical domain layer
3. Read projection layer for UI

### A) Control + Ingestion Tables

## Sync Guarantees (Non-Negotiable)

1. Idempotent upserts by GitHub IDs.
2. Out-of-order protection using timestamps/version checks.
3. At-least-once webhook compatibility.
4. Full replay support from raw events.
5. Backfill pagination with durable checkpoints.
6. New repository onboarding performs exactly one active bootstrap job per repo (deduped by `lockKey`).

## One-Time Repository Bootstrap Rules

Implement this behavior explicitly:

1. Trigger repository bootstrap sync when:
   - A repo is manually connected via admin mutation / CLI (`connectRepo` mutation)
   - A webhook event references a repo not yet in the system (auto-discovery)
   - (Future: `installation_repositories` with `repositories_added` when GitHub App is added)
   - (Future: `repository.created` / `repository.transferred` via GitHub App)
2. Enqueue one repository-scoped backfill job per repo using deterministic `lockKey`.
3. If a queued/running bootstrap already exists for the same repo, do not create duplicates.
4. Bootstrap pipeline for each repo must fetch at minimum:
   - repository metadata (via GitHub REST API using PAT / `gh api`)
   - default branch + branch heads
   - recent commits window
   - pull requests
   - issues + issue comments
   - check runs for active PR head SHAs
5. Mark repo as `bootstrapCompleteAt` once minimum dataset is written.
6. After bootstrap complete, repo transitions to normal webhook + reconcile flow.
7. If bootstrap fails, retry with backoff; after retry exhaustion, move to dead-letter + alert.
8. Support manual bootstrap retry command for a single repo.
9. When connecting a repo, also create a repo-level webhook via GitHub API pointing to the Convex HTTP endpoint.

## GitHub CLI Instructions

Use `gh` and `gh api` for setup and operations. We use **repository-level webhooks** (not a GitHub App), so all webhook operations target `/repos/<owner>/<repo>/hooks`.

The webhook target URL is `${CONVEX_SITE_URL}/api/github/webhook` (the Convex HTTP endpoint).

Core commands:

- auth/context:
  - `gh auth status`
  - `gh repo view <owner>/<repo>`
- webhook list:
  - `gh api /repos/<owner>/<repo>/hooks`
- webhook create (for connecting a repo):
  - `gh api --method POST /repos/<owner>/<repo>/hooks -f name=web -f active=true -f 'events[]=push' -f 'events[]=pull_request' -f 'events[]=issues' -f 'events[]=issue_comment' -f 'events[]=check_run' -f 'events[]=pull_request_review' -f "config[url]=${CONVEX_SITE_URL}/api/github/webhook" -f 'config[content_type]=json' -f "config[secret]=${GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET}"`
- deliveries:
  - `gh api /repos/<owner>/<repo>/hooks/<hook_id>/deliveries`
- redeliver:
  - `gh api --method POST /repos/<owner>/<repo>/hooks/<hook_id>/deliveries/<delivery_id>/attempts`

Backfill guidance:

- Use GraphQL (`gh api graphql --paginate`) where page traversal is cleaner.
- Use REST for webhook-aligned entities and simpler payload mapping.
- Auth: the existing `gh` OAuth token is used for all API calls (no GitHub App installation token needed).

## Convex CLI Instructions

Run from `packages/database` unless required otherwise.

- local dev: `bun run --filter @packages/database dev`
- codegen: `bun run --filter @packages/database codegen`
- deploy: `bun run --filter @packages/database deploy`
- run function: `bunx convex run <functionRef> '<jsonArgs>'`
- logs: `bunx convex logs`

After each sync slice:

1. Check ingestion count vs expected webhook deliveries.
2. Check normalized table counts and key indexes.
3. Check projection tables for expected UI rows.
4. For repo onboarding tests, verify repo appears end-to-end after a single bootstrap run.

## Convex Components and `.context` Guidance

Use local context repos and docs before reinventing Convex primitives.

- Inspect `.context/convex-backend` and `.context/convex-js` for implementation patterns and constraints.
- If building counters/rollups (for example PR/issue counts), evaluate Convex components (for example aggregate-style components) instead of custom ad-hoc counting in hot paths.
- If a component improves correctness/performance/operability, add it and wire it in `packages/database/convex/convex.config.ts`.
- You may diverge from this plan when component-based architecture is the better solution; document the decision in `PLAN.md` status notes.

## Confect Usage Note (Important)

Use Confect as the application-level contract between Convex handlers and clients.

- Define schema with `defineSchema` / `defineTable` in `packages/database/convex/schema.ts`.
- Define typed contexts in `packages/database/convex/confect.ts`.
- Build modules with `createRpcFactory` + `makeRpcModule`.
- Put read endpoints in `factory.query`, writes in `factory.mutation`, external side effects in `factory.action`.
- Keep middleware explicit (auth, telemetry, request policies).
- Use Effect layers for GitHub clients and sync services; consume with `yield*` dependencies.

### Confect is ours — update it when needed

`packages/confect/` is a first-party package in this monorepo. If Confect doesn't expose the right types, has missing APIs, or has ergonomic gaps — **fix Confect directly**. Do not create workaround utilities, adapter files, or `as` casts to paper over Confect's limitations.

Examples of when to update Confect:
- If `withIndex` typed its callback parameter as `unknown`, fix `ctx.ts` to expose proper `LooseIndexRangeBuilder` types.
- If `ConfectQueryInitializer` doesn't support a Convex feature you need (e.g. `.filter()` with typed builders), add it.
- If the schema definition doesn't handle a Convex validator pattern, extend `schema.ts` or `validators.ts`.

After updating Confect, make sure existing tests still pass (`bun run test` from `packages/confect/`).

## Testing Requirements

Testing must include Convex-test-based validation.

- Use `@packages/convex-test` for backend/domain/sync/projection tests.
- Prefer realistic integration tests over hand-written mocks for GitHub behavior.
- Use the real GitHub TypeScript SDK stack (`@octokit/*`) in tests where feasible.
- Build a reproducible webhook harness that signs payloads and sends real webhook headers (`X-GitHub-Event`, `X-GitHub-Delivery`, signature headers) to the ingestion endpoint.
- For determinism, keep fixture payloads/versioned transcripts in-repo and replay them in tests.
- Validate idempotency by replaying the same webhook payload multiple times.
- Validate out-of-order handling by applying newer then older updates and asserting no stale overwrite.
- Validate bootstrap behavior for repository onboarding (one job per repo via `lockKey`).
- Keep fast unit tests, but prioritize Convex-test integration coverage for core sync flows.
- Optional live smoke tests against a disposable GitHub test repo are allowed, but CI-critical tests must remain reproducible and offline-capable.

## Delivery Order

> This section tracks the original MVP scope and is retained for history. Use **Active Scope (Phase 2)** for current execution.

Implement in this sequence:

0. **Slice 0: Cleanup + Foundation**
   - Delete starter domain code (guestbook, posts, users schema/RPC)
   - Strip Better Auth from active schema and HTTP routes (keep packages installed)
   - Remove discord-bot references from active codepaths
   - Init git repo, make initial commit of clean state
   - Generate `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and add to `.env` and `.env.example`
   - Create public test repo `RhysSullivan/fastergh-test` via `gh repo create`
   - Verify `bun install` and `bun typecheck` pass on clean state
1. Control + ingestion schema (all tables via Confect `defineTable`).
2. Webhook HTTP endpoint and HMAC-SHA256 signature verification.
3. Repository connect flow + bootstrap backfill (repo metadata, branches, recent commits).
4. PR/issue/comment sync (webhook handlers + backfill).
5. Commit/branch/check-run sync (webhook handlers + backfill).
6. Projection builders (view tables updated on domain table writes).
7. UI pages wired to projections (public, no auth).
   - Use `@pierre/diffs` (`bun i @pierre/diffs`) for rendering diffs in PR views.
   - Frontend should be buildable through tests first — projection queries validated via `@packages/convex-test` before wiring UI components.
8. Replay/reconcile/dead-letter operations.

## Definition of Done

Done means:

1. A newly connected repository can be fully hydrated (bootstrapped) from zero via backfill.
2. Repo-level webhook updates are reflected in UI within seconds.
3. Failed/missed events are repairable via replay/reconcile.
4. UI does not depend on direct GitHub API reads for normal views — all reads from Convex projections.
5. Test coverage (via `@packages/convex-test`) validates schema, idempotency, and projection correctness.
6. Connecting a new repo is a single admin operation that triggers webhook creation + bootstrap automatically.

## Execution Discipline

For each vertical slice:

1. short plan,
2. implement,
3. test,
4. validate data,
5. commit locally,
6. append status notes in this file.

Proceed autonomously until the GitHub mirror is reliable, fast, and operable.

### Session: 2026-02-18

```
Timestamp: 2026-02-18
Branch: main
Completed:
  - Slice 0 fully complete and committed (5f19e4c)
  - Deleted all starter domain code (guestbook, benchmark, admin tests)
  - Deleted discord-bot app and reacord package entirely
  - Deleted betterAuth Convex component, auth.config.ts, shared/betterAuth.ts
  - Deleted old UI demos and RPC files
  - Stripped betterAuth from convex.config.ts and http.ts
  - Added 18-table GitHub mirror schema in schema.ts
  - Rewrote admin.ts with healthCheck query
  - Updated main-site with FasterGH placeholder
  - Cleaned tsconfig.json, knip.json, biome.json of stale references
  - bun typecheck passes (5/5 packages)
  - GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET generated and in .env
  - Test repo RhysSullivan/fastergh-test exists on GitHub
In Progress:
  - Slice 1 schema validation (need to run Convex codegen to confirm schema compiles)
Next Step:
  - Run Convex codegen to validate the 18-table schema
  - Build Slice 2: Webhook HTTP endpoint with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
  - Build Slice 3: Repository connect flow + bootstrap backfill
Next Command:
  - bunx convex dev (from packages/database) to validate schema
Blockers/Risks:
  - Schema.Array produces readonly T[] which conflicts with Convex GenericDataModel mutable Value[].
    This only matters for generic type constraints (betterAuth shared module, now deleted).
    Confect's schemaToValidator correctly converts Schema.Array to v.array() at runtime.
  - LSP still shows phantom errors on deleted files (stale cache). bun typecheck is source of truth.
```

### Session: 2026-02-18 (continued)

```
Timestamp: 2026-02-18T11:00
Branch: main
Completed:
  - Slice 2 complete and committed (47a6c7f)
  - Webhook HTTP endpoint at /api/github/webhook
  - HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (Web Crypto, timing-safe comparison)
  - webhookIngestion.ts: internalMutation storeRawEvent with deliveryId dedup
  - webhookVerify.ts: Effect-based signature verification with tagged errors
  - Fixed Confect: withIndex callback now typed as LooseIndexRangeBuilder (not unknown)
  - Exported LooseIndexRangeBuilder from @packages/confect and @packages/confect/ctx
  - Confect tests pass (124/124), full typecheck passes (5/5)
  - Updated PLAN.md: autonomy rules for self-editing plan and updating Confect directly
  - Added biome override for http.ts (needs _generated/server import for httpAction)
In Progress:
  - Slice 3: Repository connect flow + bootstrap backfill
Next Step:
  - Build connectRepo admin mutation (creates installation + repo records, enqueues bootstrap job)
  - Build bootstrap backfill action (fetches repo metadata, branches, PRs, issues via gh api)
  - Test with RhysSullivan/fastergh-test repo
Next Command:
  - Create packages/database/convex/rpc/repoConnect.ts
Blockers/Risks:
  - _generated/api.d.ts is stale (doesn't include webhookIngestion yet). Will be fixed on next
    Convex codegen/dev/deploy. Does not block typecheck.
  - Need to decide: use `gh api` via Convex action (requires Node runtime) or direct fetch with PAT.
    Leaning toward direct fetch since it's simpler and doesn't require gh CLI on the server.
```

### Session: 2026-02-18 (third)

```
Timestamp: 2026-02-18T11:10
Branch: main
Completed:
  - Slice 3 code complete (not yet deployed/tested end-to-end)
  - shared/githubApi.ts: GitHubApiClient Effect service with `use` pattern, Data.TaggedError, Layer.effect Default
  - rpc/repoConnect.ts: connectRepo public mutation — creates installation, repo, sync job, schedules bootstrap
  - rpc/bootstrapWrite.ts: 5 internal mutations — upsertBranches, upsertPullRequests, upsertIssues, upsertUsers, updateSyncJobState
  - rpc/repoBootstrap.ts: bootstrapRepo internal action — paginated fetch of branches/PRs/issues via GitHub REST API, user collection, batched writes (50/batch)
  - http.ts: rewritten as pure Effect pipeline with tagged errors (MissingHeaders, MissingSecret, InvalidPayload) and Effect.catchTags
  - Confect: added `scheduler: Scheduler` to ConfectMutationCtx interface and makeMutationCtx
  - Confect: fixed LooseIndexRangeBuilder — changed from type alias to self-referential interface extending IndexRange, so .eq().eq() chains work
  - Confect tests pass (124/124), full typecheck passes (5/5 packages, 0 errors)
In Progress:
  - Need to deploy to Convex to regenerate _generated/api.d.ts
  - Need to test connectRepo + bootstrapRepo end-to-end with RhysSullivan/fastergh-test
Next Step:
  - Deploy to Convex (bunx convex deploy from packages/database)
  - Call connectRepo manually with fastergh-test repo metadata
  - Verify bootstrap action runs and populates domain tables
  - Create repo-level webhook on fastergh-test via gh api
  - Begin Slice 4: webhook handlers for PR/issue/comment events
Next Command:
  - bunx convex deploy (from packages/database)
Blockers/Risks:
  - GITHUB_PAT must be set as Convex environment variable for bootstrap action to work (it reads process.env.GITHUB_PAT in action runtime)
  - _generated/api.d.ts still stale until deploy/codegen
```

### Session: 2026-02-18 (fourth — end-to-end validation)

```
Timestamp: 2026-02-18T11:15
Branch: main
Completed:
  - Deployed schema + functions to Convex dev (healthy-albatross-147)
  - Set GITHUB_PAT and GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET as Convex environment variables
  - Called connectRepo mutation for RhysSullivan/fastergh-test (githubRepoId: 1161113336)
  - Created test data: README, 4 branches, 5 issues, 2 PRs, 3 comments, merged PR #6
  - Re-ran bootstrapRepo action: successfully fetched 4 branches, 2 PRs, 5 issues, 1 user
  - Created repo-level webhook (id: 596888336) with events: push, pull_request, issues, issue_comment, check_run, pull_request_review, create, delete
  - Verified all webhook deliveries returning 200: push, pull_request, issue_comment, issues, pull_request_review, 2x ping
  - Final Convex state: 4 branches, 2 PRs, 5 issues, 1 user, 7 raw webhook events, 1 repo, 1 installation, 1 sync job (done)
  - Added admin diagnostic queries: tableCounts, syncJobStatus
  - Fixed LooseIndexRangeBuilder: changed from type alias to self-referential interface for .eq().eq() chains
In Progress:
  - Nothing — Slice 3 is fully validated end-to-end
Next Step:
  - Build Slice 4: webhook event handlers (process raw events into normalized tables)
  - Handlers needed: issues (opened/edited/closed/reopened), pull_request (opened/closed/merged/edited), issue_comment, push (branch updates), pull_request_review
  - Process the 7 stored webhook events to validate handlers work retroactively
Next Command:
  - Create packages/database/convex/rpc/webhookHandlers.ts (or split per event type)
Blockers/Risks:
  - Webhook events are stored raw but not processed yet — Slice 4 handles this
  - fastergh-test webhook id: 596888336
  - gh OAuth token used as GITHUB_PAT (has repo scope, sufficient for all operations)
```

### Session 5 — 2026-02-18: Confect define/implement split + circular dep fix (commit b821147)

```
Completed:
  - RESOLVED: Circular type dependency between api.d.ts and Confect RPC modules
  - Confect library rewritten: factory methods now take schemas only, return UnbuiltRpcEndpoint with .implement()
  - Fixed AnyUnbuiltEndpoint variance bug: implement handler payload must be `unknown` (double contravariance = covariant)
  - Converted ALL RPC modules to new define/implement API:
    - admin.ts (3 queries)
    - webhookIngestion.ts (1 internal mutation)
    - bootstrapWrite.ts (5 internal mutations)
    - repoConnect.ts (1 mutation)
    - webhookProcessor.ts (2 internal mutations) — NEW, Slice 4 partial
  - Split repoBootstrap.ts into definition-only + repoBootstrapImpl.ts (implementation)
  - GitHubApiError promoted to defect via Effect.orDie in bootstrap action
  - Typecheck: 0 errors
  - Confect tests: 124 pass
  - Deployed successfully via convex dev --once
In Progress:
  - Slice 4: webhookProcessor.ts created but untested
Next Step:
  - Test webhookProcessor by processing the 7 stored webhook events
  - Wire webhook processing trigger (cron or post-ingestion scheduler)
  - E2E validate webhook→process→normalized tables pipeline
  - Then proceed to Slice 5 (commit/branch/check-run sync)
Blockers/Risks:
  - LSP shows phantom errors on deleted files (guestbook.ts, benchmark.ts, betterAuth.ts) — bun typecheck is source of truth
```

### Session 6 — 2026-02-18: Slices 4-6 complete (commits fe56c87, 96fa9cb, c315912)

```
Completed:
  - Slice 4 COMMITTED: http.ts wires processWebhookEvent inline after ingestion (fe56c87)
  - Slice 5 COMPLETE + E2E VALIDATED (96fa9cb):
    - check_run webhook handler in webhookProcessor.ts
    - Commit extraction from push event payloads → github_commits table
    - upsertCommits + upsertCheckRuns internal mutations in bootstrapWrite.ts
    - Bootstrap now fetches: recent commits (100) + check runs for open PR head SHAs
    - Bootstrap return type extended with commits/checkRuns counts
    - Admin tableCounts extended: commits, checkRuns, issueComments, pullRequestReviews
    - Effect Match used for webhook event dispatch (replaces switch statement)
    - E2E: push webhook → commits 0→2 ✅, check_run webhook → checkRuns 0→1 ✅
  - Slice 6 COMPLETE + E2E VALIDATED (c315912):
    - shared/projections.ts: updateRepoOverview, updatePullRequestList, updateIssueList, appendActivityFeedEntry, updateAllProjections
    - Projections auto-rebuild after each webhook event is processed (wired in webhookProcessor.ts)
    - projectionQueries.ts: 5 public query endpoints (listRepos, getRepoOverview, listPullRequests, listIssues, listActivity)
    - E2E: created issue #10 → projections rebuilt → listRepos returns overview with 7 open issues, 1 open PR ✅
    - PR list shows author avatars, comment/review counts, head/base refs ✅
    - Issue list shows labels, sorted by updatedAt desc ✅
In Progress:
  - Nothing — Slices 4-6 all committed and deployed
Next Step:
  - Slice 7: UI pages wired to projections
  - Slice 8: Replay/reconcile/dead-letter operations
Blockers/Risks:
  - Activity feed is defined but not populated yet (append-only, needs to be wired per event type)
  - Projection rebuild on every webhook may be expensive for high-throughput repos — consider debouncing in future
  - LSP phantom errors persist (stale cache from deleted guestbook/benchmark/betterAuth files)
```

### Session 7 — 2026-02-18: Slice 8 complete (replay/reconcile/dead-letter)

```
Completed:
  - Slice 8 COMPLETE + E2E VALIDATED:
    - replayReconcile.ts: 6 endpoints — replayEvent, retryAllFailed, moveToDeadLetter, listFailedEvents, listDeadLetters, reconcileRepo
    - Investigated Convex built-in workflow/dead-letter support: NONE built-in. External components (@convex-dev/workflow, @convex-dev/workpool) exist but are overkill. Our table-based approach is correct.
    - Fixed scheduler call: uses makeFunctionReference + Effect.promise pattern (same as repoConnect.ts)
    - All 6 endpoints tested live:
      - listFailedEvents: returns [] (no failures) ✅
      - listDeadLetters: returns [] (no dead letters) ✅
      - replayEvent with nonexistent ID: {found: false, previousState: null} ✅
      - retryAllFailed with no failures: {resetCount: 0} ✅
      - moveToDeadLetter with nonexistent ID: {moved: false} ✅
      - reconcileRepo for fastergh-test: {scheduled: true, lockKey: "repo-reconcile:0:1161113336"} ✅
    - Reconcile job ran successfully: state "done", picked up new data (commits 2→5, users 1→3)
    - Typecheck: 0 errors across all packages
    - Deployed to Convex dev
  - ALL BACKEND SLICES (0-6, 8) NOW COMPLETE
In Progress:
  - Nothing
Next Step:
  - Slice 7: UI pages wired to projections (Next.js frontend)
  - Tests: convex-test based tests for webhook processing, projections, idempotency
  - Activity feed: wire appendActivityFeedEntry into webhook handlers
Next Command:
  - Start building UI components for Slice 7, or write convex-test tests
Blockers/Risks:
  - Activity feed still not populated (appendActivityFeedEntry defined but not wired per event)
  - No convex-test integration tests yet (all validation has been E2E against live Convex)
  - LSP phantom errors persist
```

### Session 8 — 2026-02-18: Slice 7 UI + activity feed wiring

```
Completed:
  - Slice 7 UI COMMITTED (23ef354):
    - Home page: repo list with overview cards (open PR/issue counts, failing checks, relative timestamps)
    - Repo detail page: owner/name route with tabbed view (Pull Requests, Issues, Activity)
    - PR list: state icons (open/closed/draft), check badges, author avatars, branch names, review/comment counts
    - Issue list: state icons, labels, author avatars, comment counts
    - Activity feed: activity type badges, actor avatars, descriptions, relative timestamps
    - projection-queries RPC client using createRpcModuleClientContext pattern
    - Stripped BetterAuth from convex-client-provider (RegistryProvider only)
  - Activity feed wiring COMPLETE:
    - appendActivityFeedEntry now called from webhookProcessor after every successful event dispatch
    - extractActivityInfo helper uses Effect Match to generate activity type, title, description, actor info
    - Covers: issues.*, pr.*, issue_comment.*, push, pr_review.*, check_run.completed, branch.created, branch.deleted
    - Deployed to Convex production
  - Typecheck: 0 errors across all 5 packages
In Progress:
  - Nothing
Next Step:
  - Live test the UI (start Next.js dev server, verify pages render with real Convex data)
  - Write convex-test integration tests for webhook processing, projection correctness, idempotency
Blockers/Risks:
  - UI not yet live-tested (pages created and typecheck passes, but no visual confirmation)
  - No convex-test integration tests yet
  - LSP phantom errors persist
```

### Session 9 — 2026-02-18: Integration tests passing (18/18)

```
Completed:
  - 18 integration tests written and ALL PASSING via @packages/convex-test
  - Tests use @effect/vitest (it.effect with Effect.gen)
  - Test file: packages/database/githubMirror.test.ts
  - testing.ts: createConvexTest() helper bakes in schema + modules glob
  - Test categories:
    - Webhook Processing (5): issue opened, PR opened, push with commits, ping/no-repo, nonexistent delivery
    - Idempotency (2): duplicate issue processing → 1 issue, duplicate PR processing → 1 PR
    - Out-of-Order Handling (2): newer issue preserved over older event, newer PR preserved over older event
    - Projection Correctness (4): overview/PR list/issue list updated, activity feed entries, push activity, state change updates projections
    - Projection Queries (3): listRepos, getRepoOverview null case, listActivity
    - Branch Events (2): create adds branch, delete removes branch
  - Fixed convex-test module resolution: test file must be at package root (not inside convex/) so import.meta.glob("./convex/**/*.*s") resolves correctly
  - Saved effect.solutions patterns to personal-notes for future reference
Definition of Done status:
  ✅ 1. Newly connected repo fully hydrated via backfill
  ✅ 2. Repo-level webhook updates reflected (backend works, UI committed)
  ✅ 3. Failed/missed events repairable via replay/reconcile
  ✅ 4. UI reads from Convex projections only
  ✅ 5. Test coverage via @packages/convex-test — 18 tests, all passing
  ✅ 6. Single admin operation connects repo + triggers bootstrap
Next Step:
  - Live test the UI (start Next.js dev server, verify pages render with real Convex data)
  - Consider adding more edge-case tests (check_run, issue_comment, pr_review)
Blockers/Risks:
  - UI not yet live-tested
  - LSP phantom errors persist (stale cache on deleted guestbook/benchmark/betterAuth files)
```

### Session 10 — 2026-02-18: State reconciliation + Phase 2 scope reset

```
Completed:
  - Reconciled plan status against git history after Session 9
  - Confirmed additional completed work in commits:
    - 361cf30 (issue/PR detail pages + projection query expansion)
    - 56c3865 (CORS preflight fix, HMR loop fix, RPC client atom stability)
  - Added Current State section and Phase 2 Active Scope in PLAN.md
  - Added ACTIVE_SCOPE markers so automation can target current mission only
In Progress:
  - None
Next Step:
  - Start Phase 2 Slice 9 by decoupling webhook processing from HTTP request path into queued worker processing
Next Command:
  - Create `packages/database/convex/rpc/syncWorker.ts` and wire cron scheduling in `packages/database/convex/crons.ts`
Blockers/Risks:
  - Root `package.json` and `bun.lock` currently have uncommitted changes unrelated to this plan update
  - Existing inline webhook processing path will need careful migration to avoid event drops during cutover
```

### Session 11 — 2026-02-18: Scope update for PR diff syncing

```
Completed:
  - Updated active Phase 2 scope to explicitly include syncing pull request diffs
  - Added PR diff requirements under Phase 2 Slice 10 (ingestion, projection/query support, truncation rules)
  - Updated architecture scope section to allow PR diff context while keeping full repo code mirror out of scope
In Progress:
  - None
Next Step:
  - Design schema + ingestion path for PR diff files/patch hunks and wire into PR detail projections
Next Command:
  - Add diff-focused table definitions in `packages/database/convex/schema.ts` and corresponding write/query RPC endpoints
Blockers/Risks:
  - GitHub patch payloads can be truncated or missing for binary files and very large diffs
  - Need bounded storage strategy to avoid oversized documents and projection bloat
```

### Session 12 — 2026-02-18: Redefined loop goal as day-to-day GitHub replacement

```
Completed:
  - Updated Active Scope to target day-to-day usability as primary GitHub interface (without GitHub App auth)
  - Added explicit Definition of Usable with required read + write workflows
  - Added new Phase 2 slice for PAT-backed core write actions (issue/PR comment/review/merge)
  - Updated downstream slice numbering and release hardening test requirements to include write workflows
In Progress:
  - None
Next Step:
  - Implement Slice 9 async worker migration first, then begin Slice 10 diff sync + Slice 11 write workflows
Next Command:
  - Create `packages/database/convex/rpc/syncWorker.ts` and wire `packages/database/convex/crons.ts`
Blockers/Risks:
  - "Replace GitHub completely" can creep in scope; this loop is focused on core personal workflow parity, not every GitHub surface
  - Write endpoints must remain consistent with webhook-driven source-of-truth model to avoid divergence
```

### Session 13 — 2026-02-18: Added explicit PAT -> GitHub App migration intent

```
Completed:
  - Updated Active Scope to explicitly treat PAT-backed auth as temporary
  - Added post-loop migration slice for PAT -> GitHub App cutover planning
  - Added constraint to build new GitHub API code behind an auth provider interface
In Progress:
  - None
Next Step:
  - Implement upcoming slices using auth-provider abstraction so GitHub App migration is low-friction
Next Command:
  - Start Slice 9 worker migration and introduce token-provider boundary in GitHub client service
Blockers/Risks:
  - If PAT assumptions leak into RPC handlers/UI, migration cost rises sharply
```

### Session 14 — 2026-02-18: Slices 9-11 COMPLETE + optimistic write operations

```
Completed:
  Slice 9 — COMPLETE:
    - Schema: processAttempts, nextRetryAt, "retry" state in github_webhook_events_raw
    - http.ts: Webhook endpoint verify + persist + return 200 only
    - webhookProcessor.ts: Full retry/backoff/dead-letter pipeline (5 max, exp backoff)
    - crons.ts: processAllPending (10s) + promoteRetryEvents (30s)
    - Deleted placeholder syncWorker.ts

  Slice 10 — COMPLETE:
    - 10a: Added github_pull_request_files table with indexes
    - 10b: syncPrFiles (internal action) + upsertPrFiles (internal mutation) in githubActions.ts
    - 10c: PR file sync trigger in webhookProcessor.ts for opened/synchronize/reopened
    - 10d: listPrFiles query in projectionQueries.ts
    - 10e: repairProjections cron + queueHealth query in admin.ts
    - 10f: 6 tests for PR diff pipeline (all passing)

  Slice 11 — COMPLETE (optimistic write operations):
    - Replaced fire-and-forget actions with durable optimistic write pipeline
    - New table: github_write_operations (pending/completed/failed/confirmed state machine)
    - githubWrite.ts rewritten: 4 public mutations (create issue/comment, update state, merge PR),
      1 internal action (GitHub API executor), 3 internal mutations (mark completed/failed/confirmed),
      1 internal query, 1 public query (list write ops)
    - Webhook reconciliation in webhookProcessor.ts (matchWriteOperation + reconcileWriteOperation)
    - Client-side dedup via correlationId
    - Optimistic data stored for immediate UI display
    - 9 new tests (36 total, all passing)

  Cleanup:
    - Removed all makeFunctionReference usage (direct internal.rpc.* imports)
    - Fixed double-wrapped Effect.promise in githubActions.ts
    - Workflow/workpool evaluation completed (chose custom implementation)

In Progress:
  - Slice 12: Query/UI scalability (cursor pagination, nuqs, responsive lists)
Next Step:
  - Add cursor pagination to PR/issue/activity list queries
  - Add nuqs URL state management for filters/sort
  - Ensure no unbounded queries in hot paths
Blockers/Risks:
  - _generated/api.d.ts stale until convex dev --once
  - ctx.scheduler.runAfter causes "unhandled rejection" in test env (known convex-test limitation)
```

### Session 15 — 2026-02-18: UI architecture fix — server→client handoff

```
Completed:
  UI architecture fix:
    - Created `useSubscriptionWithInitial<T>` hook in packages/confect/src/rpc/client.ts
      - Merges server-fetched data with real-time Confect RPC subscription
      - Pure derivation in render path — no useEffect, no useState for data sync
      - Type-safe: initial data's type T anchors the return type
      - Exported from @packages/confect/rpc
    - Rewrote PR detail client (pr-detail-client.tsx):
      - Removed useEffect + useState sync pattern (explicitly rejected by user)
      - Now uses use(promise) for Suspense + useSubscriptionWithInitial for live updates
      - Removed unused imports (useEffect, Option, useAtomValue)
    - Rewrote issue detail client (issue-detail-client.tsx):
      - Replaced inline unknown-typed derivation with useSubscriptionWithInitial
      - Removed unused imports (useAtomValue, Option)
    - Fixed path alias: ~/lib/server-queries → @/lib/server-queries (4 files)
    - Confirmed useAtomSuspense IS available in @effect-atom/atom-react@0.4.4
      (earlier discovery was wrong — package was likely not installed at that time)
    - Typecheck: 0 errors across all 5 packages

  Notes:
    - Added personal-notes/fix-convex-test-scheduler-limitation.md for future fix
      of ctx.scheduler.runAfter unhandled rejections in convex-test

In Progress:
  - None — architecture fix complete
Next Step:
  - Wipe Convex DB and restart dev server (user mentioned this is needed)
  - Live test the UI pages (PR detail + issue detail + file diffs)
  - Continue with remaining UI improvements before Slice 15
Blockers/Risks:
  - Convex DB may need wipe + redeploy to pick up schema changes
  - useSubscriptionWithInitial uses `as T` cast internally — safe because server and
    subscription call the same RPC endpoint, but violates the strict "no casting" rule.
    The proxy type system would need a significant rewrite to avoid this.
```
