By default the installation token has access to all repositories that the installation can access.

If you don't use `repositories` or `repository_ids` to grant access to specific repositories, the installation access token will have access to all repositories that the installation was granted access to. The installation access token cannot be granted access to repositories that the installation was not granted access to. Up to 500 repositories can be listed in this manner.
	 *
	 * Optionally, use the `permissions` body parameter to specify the permissions that the installation access token should have. If `permissions` is not specified, the installation access token will have all of the permissions that were granted to the app. The installation access token cannot be granted permissions that the app was not granted.

This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".
	 *
	 * The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.
	 *
	 * The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:
	 *
	 * *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.
	 * *   If merged via a [squash](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.
	 * *   If [rebased](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

	 * Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path` parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory.
	 *
	 * This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."
	 *
	 * - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks.
	 * - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).
	 * - **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.
	 *
	 * If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".
	 *
	 * If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.
	 *
	 * If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.
	 *
	 * **Notes**:
	 *
	 * - To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
	 * - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve
	 * more files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
	 * - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.
	 * - If the requested file's size is:
	 *   - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
	 *   - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty
	 * string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
	 *   - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.
